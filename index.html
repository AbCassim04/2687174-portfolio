            <p>
                I am a computer science student who loves football more than coding, although I do have an interest in problem solving and enjoy learning new technologies.
                I also love imporoving my skills as much as I love liverpool.

            <p>
                My latest project is a simple portfolio website built using semantic HTML5.
                The goal of the project was to practice clean structure and accessibility.
